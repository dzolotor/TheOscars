## The Oscars

This project accomplishes the following<br>
 
1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account<br>
2. Download any of the data sets from previous projects<br>
3. Load the data set into panda data frames<br>
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how storytelling and visualization would help describe the data set and establish additional value<br>
5. Build three or more compelling visualizations<br>
6. Document your process and results<br>
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub<br>

## Motivation 

Storytelling of data is critical to the prgression of any industry. In this notebook, we will use basic NFL data to demonstrate how visualizations can help both technical and non technical people understand data.

## Results

The data shows that NFL's average score per season climbed until 1950 and has trended sideways since.<br>
Using this fact, we investigate how 8 of 32 teams' average score per game changes from season to season.<br>
This means the draft is effective in mean reverting the best and worst teams of the league to keep the game competitive.<br>
Finally we look at the distribution of elo for 2018 and see that the majority of the teams fall into the upper range for elo.<br>
